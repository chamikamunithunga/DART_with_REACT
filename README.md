Dart Back-End with React Front-End
-----------------------------------
This project demonstrates how to set up a Dart back-end using shelf, with CORS support, and connect it to a React front-end.

Project Structure
------------------
Back End: Built with Dart and shelf to handle HTTP requests.
Front End: A React app that fetches data from the Dart back-end using fetch.

Prerequisites
--------------
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:


Dart SDK: Install Dart
Node.js & npm: Install Node.js

Features
---------
Dart Server: Uses shelf to handle HTTP requests.
React Front End: Fetches data from the Dart server using fetch.
CORS: Ensures cross-origin requests are allowed between the back end and front end.

Future Improvements
-------------------
Add more routes to the Dart back end for additional data.
Enhance the React front end with more features and UI improvements.
Integrate a database for persistent data storage in the back end.
